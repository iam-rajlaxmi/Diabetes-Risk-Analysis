# Diabetes-Risk-Analysis
This project focuses on building a Diabetes Risk Prediction model using XGBoost to analyze clinical parameters such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The model predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes, providing insights for early diagnosis and timely interventions.

ðŸ›  Features:
XGBoost Algorithm: A robust machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

High Accuracy: Achieved significant accuracy in predicting diabetes risk based on clinical data.

Python Implementation: Developed using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost libraries.

Data Analysis: Utilized a dataset containing relevant clinical features for training and testing.

ðŸ“„ Use Case:
This model aids in early detection of diabetes risk, supporting healthcare professionals in providing timely advice and preventive care to individuals. It can be integrated into health apps to assess diabetes risk based on user data.

ðŸš€ Technologies:
Python

XGBoost for classification

Scikit-learn for machine learning pipeline

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
